### Hi there 👋

I believe that the quality of a coder depends more on their attitude than their technical prowess.

I think that all the programmers around the world should think twice about what are they coding and the usage that will be done. We must carry the responsibilities of our own code.

I will never write down code that aims to hurt someone or damage something and I will do my best for the success of client's business.

I believe that open-source is one of the most important idea on the IT world. Being able to contribute to any type of open-source project to make the nicest software makes us programmers like a very big family.

An individual is not perfect, no one is able to do everything but if we share our projects making them open-source we will get the chance to get help from people that have more experience than us and continue our growth.
